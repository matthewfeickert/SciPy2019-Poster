# SciPy 2019 Poster
Poster on pyhf for the SciPy 2019 poster session

## [Poster Guidelines](https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/info-for-presenters)

Poster presenters are asked to set up your posters, in the Ballroom before 9:00 am on Wednesday, July 10th.
(The Grand Ballroom will be available for set up between 7:30 and 9:00 am on Wednesday, July 110h.)
Your poster will remain on display there through the entirety of the conference.

Presenters will stand near their posters during the poster session, Wednesday evening.
Please retrieve your poster on Friday, July 12th during the lunch break.

Please bring a poster of reasonable size.
Our poster stands are made up of 2 upright poles, 2 horizontal bars and 2 bases (no wheels.)
Posters are commonly 36 or 42 inches tall and can be 72 inches wide.
Posters that are taller can hang below the bottom horizontal bar.

We use foam core board on our stands in case someone needs to pin something to the background.
We provide large metal clips to fasten posters to the metal bars if needed, and we will have some thumbtacks available to help fasten items to the foam core boards, if needed.

If you need to make any changes to the title, description or co-authors on your talk or poster, please contact Jill Cowan scipy@enthought.com.
